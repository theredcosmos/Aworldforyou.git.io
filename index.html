        <p>Loving yourself might not come easy to some people, but it is definitely the first thing you should do if you want to be happy.
            Loving yourself every single day, through the highs and lows of life, will empower you to blossom and thrive in a way youâ€™ve never experienced before. Although each one of us will practice self-love in our own unique ways, as long as you give yourself the importance you deserve, it can help you discover new aspects of yourself.
        <h3>Self-love is a journey that requires time, effort, devotion, practice, and dedication.</h3>

    <p>The moment you start respecting yourself and accept yourself fully for who you are, you will notice that your life becomes more positive, and you look forward to living it to the fullest. Getting respect, and appreciation from your loved ones is important, but respecting yourself and treating yourself kindly is much more important.</p>
    <p>However, self-love should not be confused with being narcissistic or self-absorbed. Having self-deprecating thoughts is natural for all of us. Loving yourself gives us the strength to silence those negative voices and our well-being and our happiness instead.</p>
    <p>Accepting yourself is the first step towards self love. If you want to be happy, fall in love with yourself.</p>
